This is a JSON API wrapper around the `iching` library.

It provides the following endpoints:

    POST: /reading (with 'question' value provided by client)
    GET: /reading (no question provided by client)
    GET: /hexagrams/{hexagram number}
    GET: /hexagrams

POST a 'question' to /reading or just GET it -- you'll receive a generated
hexagram and "NextHexagram" if the lines in the first hexagram are changing. The
only difference is, you'll get back the question the client asked if one is
provided.

GET a single hexagram by its number (see:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_hexagrams_of_the_I_Ching) or all hexagrams
at /hexagrams.
